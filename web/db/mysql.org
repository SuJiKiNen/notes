1. ~truncate table_name~ will reset =auto_increment=
2. between is [min,max]
3. date range
#+BEGIN_SRC
WHERE datetimecol >= '2012-12-01'
  AND datetimecol <  '2012-12-02'
#+END_SRC
#+BEGIN_SRC
WHERE datetimecol between '2012-12-01'
  AND '2012-12-02'
#+END_SRC

between is faster? but not good for one

day interval query,it has overlapping
