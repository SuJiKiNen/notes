can't view logger from web UI in standalone mode

add a custom function to get ip

#+BEGIN_SRC python
hostname_callable = dags.utils:get_ip
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC python
def get_ip():
    net_int_name = os.environ['NET_INT_NAME']
    ip = netifaces.ifaddresses(net_int_name)[netifaces.AF_INET][0]['addr']
    return ip
#+END_SRC

add dags parent folder to PYTHONPATH avoding can't ~get_ip~


airflow webserver call gunicorn

this [[https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/issues/1349][issue]] seems add CWD to PYTHONPATH,but still can't find ~get_ip~
